# Automatic-prompt-optimization-for-medical-prompts


## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an **Automatic Prompt Optimization** method using **text-based gradient descent** and **momentum techniques**. The goal is to optimize prompt engineering strategies for **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, enhancing their performance in medical datasets by up to **20%**. Additionally, the project introduces a **Bayesian reverse validation method** to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of prompt optimization, significantly boosting the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

We utilize **Langchain** for model orchestration, implement API calls, and explore the **local deployment** of large models. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art tools and methodologies to push the boundaries of LLM performance in the medical field.
